  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>These delicious teriyaki chicken wings are a hit at every party!
     I made 10 pounds of these wings for a recent get-together, 
     and not one wing was left at the end of the night.
  </p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>1 cup water</li>
    <li>1 cup soy sauce</li>
    <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
    <li>¼ cup pineapple juice</li>
    <li>¼ cup vegetable oil</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon minced fresh garlic</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger</li>
    <li>3 pounds chicken wings or drumettes</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol class="steps-list">
    <li>Whisk water, soy sauce, sugar, pineapple juice, vegetable oil, garlic, and ginger together in a large glass or ceramic bowl until sugar has dissolved. Add chicken wings and toss to evenly coat. 
      Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour.
    </li>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). 
      Grease baking dishes and set them aside.
    </li>
    <li>Remove chicken wings from marinade; shake off excess and place the chicken wings into the prepared baking dishes. 
      Discard the remaining marinade.
    </li>
    <li>Bake chicken wings in the preheated oven until chicken is cooked through and glaze is evenly browned, about 1 hour. 
      An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
    </li>
