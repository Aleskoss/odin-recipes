My first project from The Odin project curriculum
It is a project about creating a recipe page, where I will demonstrate skills that I have learnt up until now, primarily working with HTML(headers, paragraphs, links and images(showing absolute and relative paths), lists(ul,ol) also italicaze text through em and make it bold with strong element) + some attributes to these elements
